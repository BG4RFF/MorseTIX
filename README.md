MorseTIX
========

An Arduino library to aid in sending Morse code.

Now including an extremely simplistic transmitter circuit which I am attempting to design.  Please do not make use of it unless you are:

 - licensed as an amateur radio operator in an applicable country
 - willing to complete or modify the circuit to reduce spurious emissions and otherwise enable it to adhere to FCC regulations and good amateur practice.

In other words, it's not anywhere near complete and you have been warned!
